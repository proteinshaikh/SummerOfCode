/*
*
* Interpolation search is an improved variant of binary search.
* This search algorithm works on the probing position of the required value.
* For this algorithm to work properly, the data collection should be in a sorted form and equally distributed.

Binary search has a huge advantage of time complexity over linear search.
* Linear search has worst-case complexity of Ο(n) whereas binary search has Ο(log n).

There are cases where the location of target data may be known in advance.
* For example, in case of a telephone directory, if we want to search the telephone number of Morphius.
* Here, linear search and even binary search will seem slow as we can directly jump to memory space
* where the names start from 'M' are stored.
